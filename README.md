# Numerical solution of Kiyotaki & Moore (1997) "Credit Cycles".

Jupyter and Google Colab notebooks reproducing the numerical solution of Kyotaki & Moore (1997). This Notebook reproduces Figure 3 of the paper (available in the doc folder). It uses a shooting algorithm to find the Initial Value Condition that reproduces the cyclicality of the full non-linear model, while converging to the steady state in the long run.
